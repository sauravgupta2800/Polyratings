Project: Polyrating


This file provides an overview of the project, highlighting any changes in goals since the midterm report and the completed deliverables.


1. Changes in Goals Since Midterm Report: No changes have been made since the report that I submitted for the mid-term report.
2. The following deliverables have been completed:
   * Screen for Rating a Professor: Users can access this screen to provide ratings and reviews for professors. The input data is processed and saved in the app's database.
   * Screen for Adding a Professor: Users can navigate to this screen to add new professors to the app's database. They can provide relevant information about the professor, such as name, department, and rating qualifications.
   * Professor Detail Page: This page displays detailed information about a selected professor, including their name, department, qualifications, and average rating based on user reviews.
   * Review Section (flag a review): Users can view reviews provided by other users and have the option to flag inappropriate or irrelevant reviews. Flagged reviews can be reviewed by app administrators for further action.
   * Search and Filter Functionalities: The app offers search and filter capabilities to help users find specific professors based on criteria such as name, department, or rating. This enhances the user experience and makes it easier to discover relevant information.
   * Recommendations based on the highest-rated professors: The app provides recommendations by showcasing professors with the highest ratings. Users can explore these recommendations to find highly regarded professors.




Optional:
Publishing on Google Play Store: Unfortunately, due to unforeseen circumstances, we were unable to complete the necessary steps to publish the app on the Google Play Store. However, this does not affect the functionality and usability of the app itself. Users can still access and utilize the app locally through GitHub (https://github.com/sauravgupta2800/Polyratings)
